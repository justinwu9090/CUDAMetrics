# CUDAMetrics - Comparing Algorithm Performances

This is project demonstrating various CUDA kernels (Add, Mat-Mult, FFT) implementation and performance analysis. Each algorithm will consist of the following implemenations:
1. Sequential
2. CUDA - Naive
3. CUDA - shared memory
4. Various grid/block dimensions

## Execution Environment
The project was ran on a personal desktop with the following hardware/software system settings:

	Hardware:
		CPU: AMD Ryzen 5 5600X 6-Core Processor 3.70 GHz (non over-clocked)

		GPU: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1660 SUPER
			maxThreadsPerMultiProcessor: 1024
			maxBlocksPerMultiProcessor: 16
			multiProcessorCount: 22

	Software:
		CUDA: v12.2 via Visual Studio 2022
